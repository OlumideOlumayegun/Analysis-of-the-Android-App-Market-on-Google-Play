Mobile apps are an integral part of modern life, offering a wide range of functionalities from entertainment to productivity. With the ease of app development and the potential for significant financial returns, the mobile app market continues to expand rapidly. As a result, more apps are being developed every day, contributing to a highly competitive and dynamic ecosystem.

In this notebook, we will perform a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by examining data from over ten thousand apps available on the Google Play Store. By exploring key metrics across various app categories, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can inform strategies for app growth and user retention.

Our analysis will address the following key questions:
- What are the most popular app categories?
- How do user ratings and reviews vary across different types of apps?
- What pricing models (free vs. paid) are most prevalent, and how do they impact app success?
- Are there patterns in app size, update frequency, or installation numbers that correlate with app performance?

Through data visualisation and exploration, this notebook seeks to provide actionable insights for app developers, marketers, and stakeholders in the Android app ecosystem.
